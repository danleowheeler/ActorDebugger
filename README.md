# Actor Debugger UE Plugin

Intended to demonstrate some Unreal Engine tool functionality.

To use, install into your project, regenerate your project files and build.

Call the SelectActor Blueprint library function from within a blueprint to show the debugger window.

This will show a Slate window which will show a tree view of the properties of that actor.
